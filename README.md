# Wave Function Collapse for Networks

This is code forked from the [Oisin](https://github.com/mewo2/oisin) implementation of WFC.


If you do make something interesting with this code, please do still let me know! I'm sorry that I can't provide any support, but I am still genuinely interested in seeing creative applications of the code.
