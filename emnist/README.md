### dataset

NIST handwritten characters. Probably the best stroke-based dataset available on short notice, pre-rasterized.

### architecture

Attentive writer due to @ericjang https://github.com/ericjang/draw

Via the blogpost of @kvfrans, which is enough of an overview to make my 'knowledge' of the architecture dangerous, I think.

It'd be nice to control which mode the architecture will draw, for one. Yet somehow I mistook that axis for the 'stroke count' one.
